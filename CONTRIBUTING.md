# General component requirements

When adding new components they must have:
- Full test coverage (using ava)
- [JSDoc documentation](#docs)
- Flow types
- Strict semver versioning
- A working [example](#examples)

---

# Specific component requirements

## Inputs

Inputs have a strict common interface to ensure predictable usage and compatibility with [redux form](http://redux-form.com/). All components will be controlled.

### Props
#### Input props
 - `value: string|boolean` - the value that the input will show as being selected, or a boolean if the input represents a single boolean value such as a checkbox
 - `onChange: (newValue: string|boolean|array<string>|array<boolean>, ???...) => void` - a callback function that will be called by the input component when the value must change. NewValue is a string, unless multi is true in which case it is an array of strings
 - `disabled: boolean = false` - if true, the input should appear disabled and not accept user input
 - `placeholder: string` - placeholder text where applicable
 - `options: array<object>` - if input accepts multiple options these must be an array of {label: string, option: string, disabled: boolean} // what about immutable lists?
 - `multi: boolean = false` - if input accepts options and multi={true}, more than one option may be chosen at once
 - `clearable: boolean = true` - allows the input to be cleared / have zero choices selected

#### standard stampy props
 - `modifier: string` - spruce class modifier

#### other standard react / html props
 - `className: string` - class attribute
 - `onFocus: function`
 - `onBlur: function`
 - `onKeyUp: function`

# Examples

All components should be accompanied by implementation examples. Simple code examples can be placed in [JSDoc comments](http://usejsdoc.org/tags-example.html) but any complex or varied functionality that the component allows should be shown with working examples in the [example](/example) folder.

## Building the examples

You can run the examples build from the parent stampy folder by running:

```
yarn run build-examples
```

This will cd into the example folder and run `yarn install` and `yarn run build`. Once the task finishes you can view the examples by running your favourite webserver in the `example` folder.


## Developing examples

The example folder contains a basic webpack/babel build setup. To start working on examples go into the example folder and run:

```
yarn install
```

The two main tasks are _build_ and _watch_.

```
yarn run build
```
Will do a production build of the examples.

```
yarn run watch
```
will start up webpack-dev-server and allow for rapid development.

New examples should be added to the list in [IndexPage.jsx](/example/src/components/IndexPage.jsx).

# Docs

Documentation is written using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) comments.

@TODO add more info here about documentation standards.
